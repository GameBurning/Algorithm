no,brief description,solution,time,space
*10,regular expression matching,
17,letter combination of a phone number,bfs每一轮清空deque
24,swap adjacent nodes,use a dummyNode and assign them
26,remove dup from sorted array ,detect nums[i] != nums[i-1] and swap it with a starting pointer
43,multiply strings,use a 2D matrix and store only results of (one digit * one digit)
75,sort colors,count the number and insert them or run two pointers
91,decode ways,dp and 0 as a special case
278,first bad version,binary search combined with n[i] != n[i+1]
283,move zeros,like a color sort
311,sparce matrix multiplication,use a dict to store non-zero values in B and (i,j) as key to boost performance
*314,binary tree vertical order traversal,defaultdict(list) to store vertical levels; bfs to trevalse,*o(nlogn)
